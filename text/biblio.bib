  abstract = {Active fire detection in satellite imagery is of critical importance to the management of environmental conser­ vation policies, supporting decision-making and law enforcement. This is a well established field, with many techniques being proposed over the years, usually based on pixel or region-level comparisons involving sensorspecific thresholds and neighborhood statistics. In this paper, we address the problem of active fire detection using deep learning techniques. In recent years, deep learning techniques have been enjoying an enormous success in many fields, but their use for active fire detection is relatively new, with open questions and demand for datasets and architectures for evaluation. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a new large-scale dataset for active fire detection, with over 150,000 image patches (more than 200 GB of data) extracted from Landsat-8 images captured around the world in August and September 2020, containing wildfires in several locations. The dataset was split in two parts, and contains 10-band spectral images with associated outputs, produced by three well known handcrafted algorithms for active fire detection in the first part, and manually annotated masks in the second part. We also present a study on how different convolutional neural network architectures can be used to approximate these handcrafted algorithms, and how models trained on automati­ cally segmented patches can be combined to achieve better performance than the original algorithms – with the best combination having 87.2\% precision and 92.4\% recall on our manually annotated dataset. The proposed dataset, source codes and trained models are available on Github (https://github.com/pereira-gha/activefire), creating opportunities for further advances in the field.},

  abstract = {Climate change has increased the prevalence of wildfires, resulting in longer fire seasons and larger geographic area burned. The aim of this work was to assess the air pollution and health risk to the population caused during exposure to smoke in fire season. The study design included: an analysis of long-term air pollution to determine background levels; an analysis of short-term ({$<$}24 h) and subchronic (10–14 days) concentrations during wildfires; and an assessment of the health risk in the industrial center of the Baikal region (Russia). In Irkutsk, at a distance of 2000 km from the fire focal points, the maximum short-term concentrations of pollution were noted during the smoke period, when the average CO level increased 2.4 times, and PM1 increased 1.4 times relative to the background levels in August 2021. In Bratsk, located near the fires, the increases in short-term concentrations were: CO—21.0; SO2—13.0; formaldehyde—12.0; TPM—4.4 times. The hazard indices of respiratory and coronary diseases in the burning period exceeded the acceptable level. Acute reactions to smoke can be expected in 30\% of the exposed population near fires and 11\% in remote areas (Bratsk). The results obtained from the remote sensing of atmospheric smoke can be used to urgently resolve the issue of organizing medical assistance or evacuating the population groups most sensitive to the effects of smoke in fire season.},

  abstract = {Wildfires are a major disturbance in the Mediterranean Basin and an ecological factor that constantly alters the landscape. In this context, it is crucial to understand where wildfires are more likely to occur as well as the drivers guiding them in complex landscapes such as the Mediterranean area. The objectives of this study are to estimate wildfire probability occurrence as a function of biophysical and human-related drivers, to provide an assessment of the relative impact of each driver and analyze the performance of machine learning techniques compared to traditional regression modeling. By employing an Artificial Neural Network model and fire data (2004–2012), we estimated wildfire probability across two geographical regions covering most of the Italian territory: Alpine and subalpine region and Insular and peninsular region. The high classification accuracy (0.68 for the Alpine and subalpine region and 0.76 for the Insular and peninsular region) and good performances of the technique (AUC values of 0.82 and 0.76, respectively) suggest that our model can be used in the areas studied to assess wildfire probability occurrence. We compared our model with a logistic function, which showed a weaker predictive power (AUC values of 0.78 for the Alpine and subalpine region and 0.65 for the Insular and peninsular region) compared to the Artificial Neural Network. In addition, we assessed the importance of each variable by isolating it in the model. The importance of an individual variable differed between the two regions, under­ scoring the high diversity of wildfire occurrence drivers in Mediterranean landscapes. Results show that in the Alpine and subalpine region, the presence of forest is the most important variable, while climate resulted as being the most important variable in the Insular and peninsular region. The majority of areas recently affected by large wildfires in both regions have been correctly classified by the ANN model as ‘high fire probability’. Hence, the use of an Artificial Neural Network is efficient and robust for understanding the probability of wildfire occurrence in Italy and other similar complex landscapes.},

Forests of Yakutia occupy a significant area. Forest fires annually cover an area of hundreds of thousands of hectares. The article analyzes the impact of various factors on the risk of forest fires using the linear correlation coefficient and the coefficient of determination. GIS modeling was used to predict the risk of forest fires. It was carried out in stages: the collection of different types of data and their integration into the GIS database, checking the impact of individual factors on the fire occurrence, assessing the risk of forest fires using artificial intelligence and machine learning. The study used global sources of fire information - the fire information management system (FMS). The data available in the service are collected from satellite systems and MODIS Collection 6 Active Fire Product, as well as VIIRS 375 m, 750 m. The article presents the results of assessing the impact of individual factors on the occurrence of forest fires. The analysis showed that the greatest influence was exerted by such factors as solar radiation, maximum temperature (July), NDVI index, altitude, slope, human factor (distance to roads, distance from settlements and rivers). The following artificial intelligence and machine learning methods were used to assess fire risk: random forest and maximum entropy methods. With the help of GIS modeling, geographical maps of the risk of forest fires in Yakutia were created. The maps highlight areas of very low, low, medium, high, very high and extremely high probability of forest fires.},

It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

  abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size \{\textbackslash epsilon\} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter \{\textbackslash epsilon\} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence has been applied in wildfire science and management since the 1990s, with early applications including neural networks and expert systems. Since then, the field has rapidly progressed congruently with the wide adoption of machine learning (ML) methods in the environmental sciences. Here, we present a scoping review of ML applications in wildfire science and management. Our overall objective is to improve awareness of ML methods among wildfire researchers and managers, as well as illustrate the diverse and challenging range of problems in wildfire science available to ML data scientists. To that end, we first present an overview of popular ML approaches used in wildfire science to date and then review the use of ML in wildfire science as broadly categorized into six problem domains, including (i) fuels characterization, fire detection, and mapping; (ii) fire weather and climate change; (iii) fire occurrence, susceptibility, and risk; (iv) fire behavior prediction; (v) fire effects; and (vi) fire management. Furthermore, we discuss the advantages and limitations of various ML approaches relating to data size, computational requirements, generalizability, and interpretability, as well as identify opportunities for future advances in the science and management of wildfires within a data science context. In total, to the end of 2019, we identified 300 relevant publications in which the most frequently used ML methods across problem domains included random forests, MaxEnt, artificial neural networks, decision trees, support vector machines, and genetic algorithms. As such, there exists opportunities to apply more current ML methods — including deep learning and agent-based learning — in the wildfire sciences, especially in instances involving very large multivariate datasets. We must recognize, however, that despite the ability of ML models to learn on their own, expertise in wildfire science is necessary to ensure realistic modelling of fire processes across multiple scales, while the complexity of some ML methods such as deep learning requires a dedicated and sophisticated knowledge of their application. Finally, we stress that the wildfire research and management communities play an active role in providing relevant, high-quality, and freely available wildfire data for use by practitioners of ML methods.},

Mainly low-intensity surface fires occur in larch forests, whereas in evergreen forests both surface and crown fires are observed. Warming has led to an increase in the frequency and area of wildfires that have reached the Arctic Ocean shore. However, wildfires are the most important factor in taiga dynamics; larch and Scots pine have evolved under conditions of periodic forest fires, thereby gaining a competitive advantage over non-fire adapted species; in the permafrost zone, periodic fires are a prerequisite for the dominance of larch. Wildfires support ecosystem health, biodiversity, and conservation; periodic wildfires decrease the danger of catastrophic wildfires. With an amplified rate of increase in fires, it is necessary to focus fire suppression on areas of high social, natural, and economic value, while allowing a greater number of wildfires to burn in the vast Siberian forest landscapes.},

Проведен детальный анализ влияния различных факторов на формирование и развитие системы. Показано, что в настоящее время ИСДМ-Рослесхоз позволяет получать объективную информацию о пожарах, действующих на территории России, и обеспечивать многоуровневую систему контроля по их предупреждению и тушению, в том числе, проверку достоверности предоставляемых регионами сведений пожарах и их последствиях. Описан технологический прорыв в развитии системы в 2015–2018 гг., связанный с вводом в эксплуатацию новых спутниковых систем дистанционного зондирования Земли. Это позволило существенно расширить возможности ИСДМ-Рослесхоз, обеспечив, в частности, повышение регулярности наблюдений и возможность гарантированного получения спутниковых данных достаточно высокого пространственного разрешения (от 10 до 50 м) для уточнения площади, пройденной конкретным пожаром. Выполнен обзор текущих задач системы и отмечено, что одной из перспективных задач развития ИСДМ-Рослесхоз, для которой в настоящий момент имеется вся технологическая основа, является внедрение технологии принятия управленческих решений определения необходимости тушения конкретного лесного пожара с учетом информации, полученной на основе оперативного моделирования его развития и возникающих при этом угроз. В работе фактически обосновано, что ИСДМ-Рослесхоз является технологической платформой для создания комплексной системы дистанционного мониторинга лесных ресурсов России, которая может быть создана в ближайшие годы на основе современных методов и технологий спутникового мониторинга лесов.},

This paper presents a model for predicting the scale of forest wildfires of Alberta, Canada. A fire's scale is determined by the combination of the fire's duration and the size of the area it burns. Our prediction model enables fire rescuers to take appropriate measures to minimize damage caused by a wildfire based on its predicted scale in the fire's early stages. The modeling data were collected from the Canada National Fire Database (CNFDB) published by Natural Resources Canada, which includes wildfire and meteorological data for Alberta, Canada. The size of the burned area and the fire's duration were used to estimate the scale of a wildfire. After multi-collinearity testing and feature normalization, the data were divided into training and testing sets. Taking the meteorological factors as input values, a backpropagation neural network (BPNN), a recurrent neural network (RNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) were implemented to establish prediction models. Of these classification methods, LSTM exhibited the highest accuracy, 90.9\%. The results indicate that it is feasible to predict the scale of a forest wildfire at the beginning of its occurrence using meteorological information.},

  abstract = {The paper contains a critical evaluation of economic substantiation of decisions by responsible governmental and regional bodies on fighting large-scale wildfires in the summer of 2019 in Siberia. The author believes that the above-mentioned substantiation considerably underestimates the risk to human life and health posed by fires. Based on (a) priorities of hazards to safety of communities, primarily those most vulnerable to the impact (the deadliest threat stems from smoke containing toxic and hazardous substances rather than blaze); and (b) WHO criteria of economic efficiency of rescue measures, it is argued that the costs (expenses) of extinguishing wildfires are socioeconomically effective. Moreover, the costs of timely measures on localization of wildfires in areas without settlements and installations (the so-called control zones) that have hotspots accessible to ground or air firefighting operations are considered highly effective. The paper argues that wildfire safety should be regarded as a national security issue requiring comprehensive policy which repudiates a formal fiscal approach still used to evaluate effectiveness of measures to reduce hazards to human health and save human lives.},

Despite this, until now there have been no detailed estimates of the scale of all types of landscape fires throughout Russia for a full calendar year. This work was aimed at providing such an assessment for landscape fires in 2020, as well as creating a publicly available map of these fires. The fires were mapped by experts and specially trained volunteers on the basis of Sentinel-2 MSI medium spatial resolution satellite images (20 m/pixel) for two periods - from January 1 to May 15, and from May 16 to December 31 inclusive. The total area of identified landscape fires was 25.84 million hectares. The division of the identified fires into presumably controlled (prescribed burning) and uncontrolled (actually fires) was not carried out within the framework of this work. However, the burned areas, corresponding to the area criterion established for single prescribed burnings (up to 10 hectares), account for only 0.96\% of the total area of detected fires. The final map of landscape fires, compiled as a result of this work, is available in the public domain at https://maps.greenpeace.org/maps/gpru/fires\_2020.},

Supported by technological improvements, wildfire risk modeling is earning relevance in several wildfire phases, covering prevention, suppression, and recovery, and encouraging the development of different products and tools. Most wildfire risk approaches reflect a broad conceptual framework that includes different but interconnected components, which can also be analyzed separately, such as likelihood, hazard, exposure, vulnerability, and coping capacity. This article presents a concise and nonexhaustive review of the methods and approaches applied to model wildfire risk and its key components, in particular since 2018, and how they can contribute to wildfire management.},

  abstract = {Modeling wildfire activity is crucial for informing science-based risk management and understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of fire-prone ecosystems worldwide. Models help disentangle the relative influences of different factors, understand wildfire predictability, and provide insights into specific events. Here, we develop Firelihood, a two-component, Bayesian, hierarchically structured, probabilistic model of daily fire activity, which is modeled as the outcome of a marked point process: individual fires are the points (occurrence component), and fire sizes are the marks (size component). The space-time Poisson model for occurrence is adjusted to gridded fire counts using the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) combined with the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach. The size model is based on piecewise-estimated Pareto and generalized Pareto distributions, adjusted with INLA. The Fire Weather Index (FWI) and forest area are the main explanatory variables. Temporal and spatial residuals are included to improve the consistency of the relationship between weather and fire occurrence. The posterior distribution of the Bayesian model provided 1,000 replications of fire activity that were compared with observations at various temporal and spatial scales in Mediterranean France. The number of fires larger than 1 ha across the region was coarsely reproduced at the daily scale, and was more accurately predicted on a weekly basis or longer. The regional weekly total number of larger fires (10–100 ha) was predicted as well, but the accuracy degraded with size, as the model uncertainty increased with event rareness. Local predictions of fire numbers or burned areas also required a longer aggregation period to maintain model accuracy. The estimation of fires larger than 1 ha was also consistent with observations during the extreme fire season of the 2003 unprecedented heat wave, but the model systematically underrepresented large fires and burned areas, which suggests that the FWI does not consistently rate the actual danger of large fire occurrence during heat waves. Firelihood enabled a novel analysis of the stochasticity underlying fire hazard, and offers a variety of applications, including fire hazard predictions for management and projections in the context of climate change.},

The trend of large-scale wildfires, with areas burnt exceeding 2,000ha, having increased over recent years, is making significant contributions to atmospheric emissions that contribute to climate change, and highlights the need for and complexity of fire risk management and monitoring. The challenges faced in monitoring and risk management can be understood in relation to the natural conditions of forest environments in Russia. Given the vast nature of the geographical area to be managed, satellite techniques are the primary means for wildfire monitoring in most part of the boreal forest zone of Russia. This increases both the efficiency of wildfire detection and the capacity to obtain information on wildfire attributes. The chapter then proceeds to discuss how the scale and remoteness of much wildfire activity, a lack of transport routes, and low density of population in northern regions of Siberia results in a high level of burn and a significant number of extreme large-scale wildfires annually. The chapter also discusses how fire risk management must accommodate the modern state politics in forestry, climate change, and the growing anthropogenic impact on fire risk.},

We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

Recent advances in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling allow inference on increasingly complex models. This class of MCMC, known as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, requires gradient information which is often not readily available. PyMC3 is a new open source probabilistic programming framework written in Python that uses Theano to compute gradients via automatic differentiation as well as compile probabilistic programs on-the-fly to C for increased speed. Contrary to other probabilistic programming languages, PyMC3 allows model specification directly in Python code. The lack of a domain specific language allows for great flexibility and direct interaction with the model. This paper is a tutorial-style introduction to this software package.},

  abstract = {The effect of climate change on the distribution, intensity, and transforming role of wild fires is considered. A general overview of the current wild fire regimes (WRs) and impacts on forest ecosystems and environment is provided. One distinctive feature of WRs is the increasing frequency of disastrous wild fires. The application of various remote sensing instruments has shown that the average vegetation wild fire area in Russia for 1998–2010 accounted for 8.2 ± 0.8 × 106 ha, with about two-thirds of wildfires occurring on forest lands and half on the forested lands. The average annual fire carbon balance during the above period was 121 ± 28 Tg C yr−1, including 92 ± 18 Tg C yr−1 emitted from the forested land. The forecasts based on the General Circulation Models suggest the dramatic acceleration of fire regimes by the end of the 21st century. Taking into account the increase in the dryness of the climate and the thawing of permafrost, this will likely lead to a dramatic loss of forested area and the impoverishment of the forest cover over a major part of the forest zone. A transition to adaptive forestry would allow a substantial decrease of the expected losses. This paper takes a brief look at the general principals of adapting forest fire protection system to climate change, which is considered an integral part of the transition to sustainable forest management in Russia.},

  abstract = {Forest fire danger rating research in Canada was initiated by the federal government in 1925. Five different fire danger rating systems have been developed since that time, each with increasing universal applicability across Canada. The approach has been to build on previous danger rating systems in an evolutionary fashion and to use field experiments and empirical analysis extensively. The current system, the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System (CFFDRS), has been under development by Forestry Canada since 1968. The first major subsystem of the CFFDRS, the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System, provides numerical ratings of relative fire potential based solely on weather observations, and has been in use throughout Canada since 1970. The second major subsystem, the Canadian Forest Fire Behavior Prediction (FBP) System, accounts for variability in fire behavior among fuel types (predicting rate of spread, fuel consumption, and frontal fire intensity), was issued in interim form in 1984 with final production scheduled for 1990. A third major CFFDRS subsystem, the Canadian Forest Fire Occurrence Prediction (FOP) System, is currectly being formulated. This paper briefly outline the history and philosophy of fire danger rating research in Canada discussing in detail the structure of the current CFFDRS and its application and use by fire management agencies throughout Canada. Key words: fire danger, fire behavior, fire occurrence prediction, fuel moisture, fire danger rating system, fire management.},

  abstract = {Fire danger systems have evolved from qualitative indices, to process-driven deterministic models of fire behavior and growth, to data-driven stochastic models of fire occurrence and simulation systems. However, there has often been little overlap or connectivity in these frameworks, and validation has not been common in deterministic models. Yet, marked increases in annual fire costs, losses, and fatality costs over the past decade draw attention to the need for better understanding of fire risk to support fire management decision making through the use of science-backed, data-driven tools. Contemporary risk modeling systems provide a useful integrative framework. This article discusses a variety of important contributions for modeling fire risk components over recent decades, certain key fire characteristics that have been overlooked, and areas of recent research that may enhance risk models.},

  abstract = {Convolutional neural networks are widely used for solving image recognition and other classification problems in which the whole image is considered as a single object. In this paper, we take the pansharpening problem of remote sensing images as an example to discuss how to establish pixel-wise regression models using convolutional neural networks. In order to meet the requirements of pixel-wise analysis on both the localization accuracy and the abstraction ability of the regression process, a U-shaped architecture is applied in our study to construct the network model. By establishing direct connections between convolution layers at the front end and the back end of the network, image features corresponding to different resolution levels can be retained. Then a regression relationship between these multi-resolution image features and the target image pixel values can be obtained. Experimental results show that the proposed regression model can effectively accomplish pansharpening, with better performance in controlling geometric deformation and color distortion, as compared to some state of the art methods.},

  abstract = {Adaptive smoothing has been proposed for curve-fitting problems where the underlying function is spatially inhomogeneous. Two Bayesian adaptive smoothing models, Bayesian adaptive smoothing splines on a lattice and Bayesian adaptive P-splines, are studied in this paper. Estimation is fully Bayesian and carried out by efficient Gibbs sampling. Choice of prior is critical in any Bayesian non-parametric regression method. We use objective priors on the first level parameters where feasible, specifically independent Jeffreys priors (right Haar priors) on the implied base linear model and error variance, and we derive sufficient conditions on higher level components to ensure that the posterior is proper. Through simulation, we demonstrate that the common practice of approximating improper priors by proper but diffuse priors may lead to invalid inference, and we show how appropriate choices of proper but only weakly informative priors yields satisfactory inference.},
